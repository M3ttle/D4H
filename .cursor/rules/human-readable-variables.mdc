# Human-Readable Variables

Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and other symbols.

## Rules

- Prefer full words over abbreviations (unless widely known: `id`, `url`, `max`)
- Names should describe purpose or content, not type
- Avoid single letters except for loop counters (`i`, `j`, `k`)

## Examples

```
// ❌ BAD
const d = new Date();
const arr = getData();
const x1 = user.age;
const fn = () => {};

// ✅ GOOD
const today = new Date();
const events = getData();
const userAge = user.age;
const handleSubmit = () => {};
```
